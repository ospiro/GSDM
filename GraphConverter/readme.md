- GraphConverter

Convert the time-course data of different dataset into graphs.

Support multiple datasets, multiple time-course cutting methods, multiple correlation methods.
These methods and parameters are provided via command arguments.
This progrem is able to load either time-course data or processed correlation data.
The output can be correlation and graph.


- Usage of this Graph Converter:

For detailed command line usage, please run this program without any parameter or with parameter "--help".

If --tcPath is given, the time-course is the input source and --corrPath is an output (if provided).
If --tcPath is not given, the correlation is the input source.



- Implementation:

-- Structure:

load input data -> (process into correlation) -> output the correlation -> process into graph -> output generated graph

-- Extension:

--- Data Sourceï¼š

Derive a new class from class TCLoader.
And implement its functions: loadValidList, getFilePath, loadTimeCourse and getAllSubjects if necessary.

--- Cutter method:

Write related constructor and init function for class TCCutter.


--- Correlation method:

Write new related calculating function in class TC2Corr.
Add the initialization for symmetric and pFunCorr in the constructor of TC2Corr.
